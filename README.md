# Fictitious clothing brand page built with React 


## Project Description

This project was one of the first that I built with React. I was tasked with building a simple page using different reusable components and props.
It consisted of a Header showcasing the user logged in, with different products rendered with unique data passed in as props. The page was made responsive using Bootstrap grid. 

## How to install and run this project

1) Open your terminal and then type

$ git clone https://github.com/KAcodes/My-Clothing-Website.git

This clones the repo

2) cd into the new folder and type

$ npm install 

This installs the required dependencies

3) To run the React project type 

$ npm start

The app will then run in development mode with path http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
